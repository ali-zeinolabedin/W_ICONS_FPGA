2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_spi_pin and CLK_REC_O are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_spi_pin] -to [get_clocks CLK_REC_O]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_spi_pin and CLK_REC_O are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_spi_pin] -to [get_clocks CLK_REC_O]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT i_w_icons_core/i_w_icons_mgmt/i_common_clkdiv_by_n/data_sync0_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT i_w_icons_core/i_w_icons_mgmt/i_common_clkdiv_by_n_discharge/FSM_onehot_stim_discharge[2]_i_4 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#3 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT i_w_icons_core/i_w_icons_mgmt/i_w_icons_sync_rst/i_common_clkgate_adc1/clk_adc1_gated_s_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#4 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT i_w_icons_core/i_w_icons_mgmt/i_w_icons_sync_rst/i_common_clkgate_adc2/clk_adc2_gated_s_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RESET_N_I relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_ref_pin, clk_spi_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SPI_CS_I relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_spi_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SPI_MOSI_I relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_spi_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SPI_MISO_O relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_spi_pin.
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
